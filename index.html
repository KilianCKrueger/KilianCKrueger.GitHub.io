            <h1>Android Development</h1>
            <p>Starting in August of 2025, I have been taking the official Android Developer course. These are the Apps I developed on my own in the order I developed them.<a
                    href="https://developers.google.com/profile/u/KilianCKrueger">See my Google Developer Badges</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Since then I have not only created several apps as part of the course but also realized my own ideas:
            </p>
            <div class="smallMargin"></div>

            <h2>üß† Train Your Brain</h2>
            <p>An App challenging you to remember the sequence of blinking buttons. Then the user recreates this
                sequence by memory. Similar to the Board Game Simon from Hasbro. 
                <a href="https://github.com/KilianCKrueger/Train_Your_Brain">Get it on GitHub</a>.</p>

            <div class="video-container">
                <video src="media/Train_Your_Brain_Video.mp4" controls></video>
            </div>
            <div class="smallMargin"></div>

            <h2>üåç Name The Domain v1</h2>
            <p>While playing GeoGuessr, I discovered that I couldn't reliably identify domains I came across. Motivated
                to memorize the domains, I created an app to practise and quiz me. It has two Game Modes:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>4 Answers - the question is displayed on top and the user selects the fitting answer from 4 buttons</li>
                <li>Typing - the user uses a TextField input to type the correct answer; there is a hint button that gives the user the first 3 letters, then fills in the correct answer</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Further, there is a switch to change whether domains or countries are asked for.
            </p>
            <div class="video-container">
                <video src="media/Name_The_Domain_Video.mp4" controls></video>
            </div>

            <h2>üåç Name The Domain v2</h2>
            <p>Name The Domain had a lot of potential, so I added</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a button (and list) to switch between questions about capitals and domains</li>
                <li>a difficulty system - for the hard mode my algorithm finds out how many entries in the answer list start with the same letter as the correct answer, then picks randomly from those with the same letter</li>
                <li>a box showing the user's streak of correct answers</li>
                <li>a help page to explain the app</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Additionally, I overhauled the GUI to look more modern; cleaned up, refactored and encapsulated the code.

            <h1>Java Apps</h1>
            <p>For more than a year now, I have developed many applications in the context of the Data Structures &
                Algorithms course.
                Outside of this course I created a console based application to assist a friend in coordinating his files for 3D printing.</p>

            <h2>üî† The Scrabble Cheater</h2>
            <p>This program requires an input of letters, of which it creates permutations. These are compared to the
                supplied dictionary, eventually outputting words that can be played in Scrabble.</p>
